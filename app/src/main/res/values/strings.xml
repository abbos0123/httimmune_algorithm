    <string name="illness_hepatitis_c">The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver.
        HBV can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death.
        With the hepatitis virus on the rise in the United States and across the globe,
        and with the opioid crisis leading to significant increases in reported cases in the United State such as
        California, which experienced a large hepatitis outbreak in 2016-2018,
        primarily among persons experiencing homelessness and/or using drugs
        in settings of limited sanitation; research programs at the Baruch S. Blumberg
        Institute are more vital now than ever before. As a non-profit 501Â©(3) organization,
        the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute puts all of our funding into our research programs
        for finding solutions for curing viral hepatitis. This funding comes to us in the form
        of donations from around the United States, as well as parts of Southeast Asia.

        Our scientists use a team-based, entrepreneurial approach to our research programs.
        Each group works together on common goals and projects while collaborating with
        scientists all across the globe including China, India, and Japan. Most importantly,
        our scientists are committed to moving our discoveries pertaining to liver cancer and
        chronic hepatitis from bench to bedside for human use as quickly as possible. Through
        this process, we can ultimately save the lives of more people suffering from liver disease
        than ever before.</string>
